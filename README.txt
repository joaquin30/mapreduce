# MapReduce

Repository: <https://github.com/joaquin30/mapreduce.git>

## Requirements

- Python 3.6+ (for subprocess.run)
- C++11 compiler (for reduce script)

## Use

    python mapreduce.py [map OR reduce] [path_to_script] [source_file] [destination_file]

## WordCount example (in Linux)

- Compile reduce.cpp: `g++ -o reduce reduce.cpp`
- Run map script: `python mapreduce.py map 'python map.py' example.txt output1.txt`
- Run reduce script: `python mapreduce.py reduce './reduce' output1.txt output2.txt`

## Notes

- map operation sends a TSV from the source file to the map script of the form:

    [number_of_line]\t[line]\n

- There is another reduce script in Python (`reduce.py`) that does the same but is slow
  due to the start and stop of the Python interpreter
